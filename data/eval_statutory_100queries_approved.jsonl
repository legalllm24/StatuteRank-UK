authority to give directions relating to specified premises, events and public outdoor places in its area. A direction may only be given if the local authority considers that the necessity and proportionality conditions set out in regulation 3(1) are met.\nBefore making a direction under these Regulations, a local authority must have regard to any guidance issued by the Scottish Ministers under regulation 2(1), as it is amended from time to time. The local authority must also have regard to any guidance issued by the Scottish Ministers under regulation 4A of the Health Protection (Coronavirus) (Restrictions) (Scotland) Regulations 2020.\nIn accordance with regulation 3, the local authority must review the direction at least once every 7 days and it must be revoked or revoked and replaced when it is determined on review that the requirements of necessity and proportionality are no longer met.\nThe local authority must publicise the making of a direction given under these Regulations in accordance with regulation 9 and inform any neighbouring local authority that such a direction has been made, in accordance with regulation 10.\nRegulation 11 provides that a direction made under these Regulations may be enforced by an officer designated by a local authority or a constable.\nRegulation 12 makes provision for offences and penalties under these Regulations.\nRegulation 13 provides that a fixed penalty may be issued by a constable to any person they reasonably believe has committed an offence under these Regulations who is aged 18 or over. The effect of regulation 13(6) is that Fixed Penalty Notices (FPNs) issued to a person under regulation 8 of the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (Aberdeen City) Regulations 2020 and regulation 9 of the Health Protection (Coronavirus) (Restrictions) (Scotland) Regulations 2020 will be taken into account in determining the penalty payable where a FPN is issued under these Regulations. Regulation 14 makes a parallel amendment to the Health Protection (Coronavirus) (Restrictions) (Scotland) Regulations 2020 in order that FPNs issued under these Regulations will be taken into account in determining the penalty payable in relation to a FPN issued under them.\nRegulation 15 provides that these Regulations expire on 31 January 2021.

An indicative map of the changes being made to these constituencies and regions is included in this note.\nThe Order defines the name, status and area of 70 of the 73 Scottish Parliament constituencies and the name and area of each Scottish Parliament region. (The Na h-Eileanan an Iar, Orkney Islands and Shetland Islands constituencies are not included in the Order because schedule 1 to the Scotland Act 1998 (“the 1998 Act”), as amended by the Islands (Scotland) Act 2018, provides for them directly). Other than the changes made to the Glasgow Provan constituency and the Coatbridge and Chryston constituency and between Glasgow region and Central Scotland region, the constituencies and regions are the same as provided by the Scottish Parliament (Constituencies and Regions) Order 2014.\nThe Order comes into force on the day after it is made (with the exception of article 4). It does not affect the return of any member to the Scottish Parliament or its constitution until the Parliament is dissolved (paragraph 6(7) of schedule 1 to the 1998 Act).\nThe 70 constituencies are named and defined by article 2 read together with schedule 1. The area of each constituency is described in geographical information system data stored on a USB memory stick deposited with the Scottish Ministers. The USB memory stick is entitled “Interim Review of Scottish Parliament Boundaries at Cardowan by Stepps” and sets out the area of each constituency, taking into account the changes recommended by the Local Government Boundary Commission for Scotland. Maps of the boundaries are available on the Local Government Boundary Commission for Scotland’s website and hard copies can be requested by writing to the Commission.\nEach constituency is (by article 2(3) and schedule 1) given the status of a burgh constituency or a county constituency.

(as amended by the second exit S.S.I. and the third exit S.S.I.), but additional deficiencies are addressed and some of the original provisions are changed.\nThese Regulations make amendments in the field of public procurement. Part 2 amends the Procurement Reform (Scotland) Act 2014 (asp 12). Part 3 amends secondary legislation. In particular, Chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 of Part 3 amend the Public Contracts (Scotland) Regulations 2015 (S.S.I. 2015/446), the Utilities Contracts (Scotland) Regulations 2016 (S.S.I. 2016/49), the Concession Contracts (Scotland) Regulations 2016 (S.S.I. 2016/65), the Procurement (Scotland) Regulations 2016 (S.S.I. 2016/145), the Public Contracts (Scotland) Regulations 2012 (S.S.I. 2012/88) and the Utilities Contract (Scotland) Regulations 2012 (S.S.I. 2012/89) respectively. Part 4 amends retained direct EU legislation. The schedule makes transitional and savings provisions.\nThese Regulations are also made in exercise of the powers conferred by paragraph 11G(1) and (3) of schedule 2 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 in order to implement Title 8 (ongoing public procurement and similar procedures) of Part 3 of the withdrawal agreement and the corresponding Title 5 of Part 3 of the EEA EFTA separation agreement. For the meaning of “withdrawal agreement”, “EEA EFTA separation agreement” and “IP completion day” see section 39(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020. In particular, the schedule to these Regulations differs markedly from the schedule to the first exit SI in providing for procedures that are ongoing on IP completion day to continue without being subject to any substantive changes in the procurement rules applicable to them. The schedule also contains various other savings that are unconnected with those agreements.\nThe power contained in section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 has been relied upon for amendments made by regulation 4(8)(a)(i) and (22)(a).\nNo business or regulatory impact assessment has been prepared in relation to these Regulations as no, or no significant, impact upon business, charities or voluntary bodies is foreseen.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "unitedkingdom:2020:ff78d7e521", "chunk_id": "unitedkingdom:2020:ff78d7e521#ae6961659b3c129", "source_url": "https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ssi/2020/468/note/made", "n_chunks_in_doc": 16, "year": 2020, "LegislationType": "Scottish Statutory Instruments", "file_name": "The Public Procurement etc. (EU Exit) (Scotland) (Amendment) Regulations 2020.txt", "chunk_position": 16, "token_count": 799}}}, {"chunk_id": "unitedkingdom:2020:ff78d7e521#51b02f0e109f479", "rel": 1, "why": "Modifies the Public Contracts (Scotland) Regulations 2012 to continue having prospective effect.", "chunk": {"content": "The Public Contracts (Scotland) Regulations 2012\n11.—(1) To the extent that the Public Contracts (Scotland) Regulations 2012(1) (“the 2012 Public Contracts Regulations”) continue to have prospective effect, their effect is modified as follows.\n(2) The 2012 Public Contracts Regulations have prospective effect as if—\n(a)\nall references in them to a “member State” continued to include the United Kingdom,\n(b)\nall requirements to send any notice to the Official Journal of the European Union were instead a requirement to submit the notice to the UK e-notification service for publication,\n(c)\nall provisions relating or referring to such a requirement, or to the publication of such a notice in that Journal, were instead references to that requirement as modified by sub-paragraph (b) and to the publication of that notice on the UK e-notification service,\n(d)\nin regulation 9(5) (which provides for the definition of certain technical specifications), the words “and to the extent that those provisions are compatible with EU obligations” were omitted,\n(e)\nregulation 14(2) (which requires certain reports to be supplied to the European Commission on request) were omitted,\n(f)\nin regulation 25(4)(a) (which provides for evidence of certain environmental management measures)—\n(i)\nin sub-paragraph (i)—\n(aa)\nsub-paragraph (aa) were omitted,\n(bb)\nin sub-paragraph (ii), the words “European or” were omitted,\n(ii)\nin sub-paragraph (ii) for “established in any relevant State conforming to EU law or the relevant European standard or” there was substituted “meeting any”,\n(g)\nregulation 30(7)(e), (8) and (9) (which relate to State aid) were omitted,\n(h)\nregulation 32(13) (which provides for the provision of certain reports requested by the European Commission) were omitted,\n(i)\nregulation 40(2) (which requires certain information to be provided for the European Commission) were omitted,\n(j)\nin regulation 47(1)(a) (which makes compliance with certain obligations a duty owed to economic operators), the words “any enforceable EU obligation” referred instead to “any retained EU obligation that is enforceable by virtue of section 4 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018”.\n(3) In paragraph (2)(b) and (c), “the UK e-notification service” has the meaning given by regulation 52(5) of the Public Contracts (Scotland) Regulations 2015.\n(4) Where—\n(a)\nimmediately before IP completion day, a procurement has been commenced,\n(b)\non or after IP completion day, a contract is awarded or any other act is done, pursuant to that procurement, and\n(c)\nthat award or other act would, if it had occurred before IP completion day, have been covered by an exemption from requirements of the 2012 Public Contracts Regulations by virtue of any provision in those Regulations,\nthat award or other act is covered by that exemption on and after IP completion day regardless of whether the terms used to define that exemption in the 2012 Public Contracts Regulations would otherwise have been apt to continue to achieve that effect on and after IP completion day.\n(5) Paragraph 11 in Part 4 of the schedule applies for the purposes of paragraph (4) as it applies for the purposes of that Part as if the reference to “the second commencement date” was a reference to the date on which paragraph (4) comes into force.\n(1)\nS.S.I. 2012/88.

corresponding proposals and policies in other parts of the United Kingdom, in the Republic of Ireland (recognising that the island of Ireland is a single biogeographic unit) or elsewhere;\n(b)\nconsult such persons as it considers appropriate (including, where appropriate, any public body responsible in any other jurisdiction for providing advice or making recommendations in connection with adaptation to, or the mitigation of the effects of, climate change);\n(c)\ncommission a financial, social, economic and rural impact assessment on the effects of the proposals and policies; and\n(d)\ngive due regard to the special economic and social role of agriculture, including the distinct characteristics of biogenic methane.\n(2) In deciding its proposals and policies for the purposes of section 29, each Northern Ireland department must also have regard to—\n(a)\nthe just transition principle (see subsection (3)), and\n(b)\nthe desirability of using and supporting nature-based projects (see subsection (5)), whether alone or together with other types of action.\n(3) The just transition principle is the importance, in taking action to reduce Northern Ireland emissions and increase Northern Ireland removals, of doing so in a manner which, so far as possible, achieves the objectives of—\n(a)\nsupporting jobs and the growth of jobs that are climate resilient and environmentally and socially sustainable,\n(b)\nin particular, supporting the agriculture sector and other sectors of the economy in Northern Ireland that are likely to be most affected by action

workers, trade unions, communities, non-governmental organisations and representatives of the interests of business and industry,\n(e)\ncreating decent, fair and high-value work in a way which does

who may have done the least to cause it or may be the least equipped to adapt to its effects,\n(h)\nreducing, with a view to eliminating, poverty, inequality and social deprivation,\n(i)\neliminating gender inequality and advancing equality of opportunity between men and women,\n(j)\nsupporting the social and economic needs of people in rural areas, and\n(k)\ntaking into account the future

effects of climate change;\n(b)\n“environmentally and socially sustainable”, when used in relation to jobs and job growth, refers to the creation and promotion of jobs in a way which conserves and improves natural resources in accordance with the future generations principle;\n(c)\nthe “future generations principle” means acting in a manner which seeks to ensure that the needs of the present are met without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\n(5) “Nature-based projects” are projects to protect, restore or sustainably manage ecosystems in order to—\n(a)\npromote both human well-being and biodiversity, or\n(b)\nprovide other environmental, social and economic benefits.\n(6) Each climate action plan must explain how the proposals and policies set out in the plan take account of the just transition principle.\n(7) Each climate action plan must explain how the Department intends to mitigate any negative effects uncovered in the relevant financial, social, economic and rural impact assessment.\n(8) The duty under subsection (2) is in addition to, and does not limit, the duty under section 25 of the Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous

These amendments extend the restrictions on the mobility component after an individual reaches the relevant age, currently detailed in regulation 25, to also apply to case transfer clients under part 3 of schedule 2 of the ADP Regulations who are terminally ill or who report a change of circumstances. An amendment is made to include new provision for when entitlement to Personal Independence Payment will end, where a client has been in receipt of Personal Independence Payment on a cycle of one week in advance and three weeks in arrears. Provision is also added to detail the payment cycles that transferees from Personal Independence Payment may receive once they are in receipt of Adult Disability Payment, and to modify the definition of “transferring individual” to ensure that it will continue to apply to all clients who have transferred from Personal Independence Payment, after their transfer is complete, and\namends references to the “care component” to be to the “daily living component”, and correct other minor wording errors.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "unitedkingdom:2022:195beb2e40", "chunk_id": "unitedkingdom:2022:195beb2e40#986dc47eb8223d7", "source_url": "https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ssi/2022/217/signature", "n_chunks_in_doc": 21, "year": 2022, "LegislationType": "Scottish Statutory Instruments", "file_name": "The Disability Assistance for Working Age People (Transitional Provisions and Miscellaneous Amendment) (Scotland) Regulations 2022.txt", "chunk_position": 21, "token_count": 957}}}]}

conditions are—\n(a)\nthat A engages in the course of conduct with the intention of causing B to suffer fear, alarm or substantial distress;\n(b)\nthat A knows, or ought in all the circumstances to have known, that engaging in the course of conduct would be likely to cause B to suffer fear, alarm or substantial distress.\n(3) If—\n(a)\nA is a UK national or is habitually resident in Northern

2022\nEXPLANATORY NOTE\n(This note is not part of the Regulations)\nThese Regulations alter the arrangements for registering certain documents in the registers under the management and control of the Keeper of the Registers of Scotland.\nThey make provision for registration in the Land Register of Scotland and the Register of Sasines as part of changes enabling digital copies of traditional (e.g. paper) documents sent electronically to be registered in the Land Register on a permanent basis, as proposed by Scottish Parliament bill (see the Coronavirus (Recovery and Reform) (Scotland) Bill). These changes would have effect in practice from the re-enactment of the temporary measures in schedule 7 of the Coronavirus (Scotland) Act 2020 (see paragraphs 11 to 14) and schedule 4 of the Coronavirus (Scotland) (No.2) Act 2020 which have similar effect.\nRegulation 2 accordingly amends the Land Register Rules etc. (Scotland) Regulations 2014 to require deeds to be registered in the Land Register by electronic means in circumstances set out in the Regulations. Deeds in the form of traditional documents (e.g. on paper) may still be registered if the computer system is unavailable, the applicant has no computer system with access to the internet, or the Keeper is otherwise satisfied that exceptional circumstances make electronic registration impractical (which includes applications to register deeds submitted by natural persons not engaging the services of a solicitor or other legal advisor).\nRegulation 3 makes similar provision for registration in the Register of Sasines in the Register of Sasines (Application Procedure) Rules 2004.\nRegulation 4 provides explicitly that the rules on annexations for electronic documents in the Electronic Documents (Scotland) Regulations 2014 apply only where an electronic signature is required for the purposes of the electronic document requirements in the Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995 (“the 1995 Act”). It also creates presumption for annexations to other electronic documents similar to those for traditional documents (inserted regulation 4(1) and (3) to (5)), and makes consequential changes to definitions including updating the provision on self-proving electronic signatures.\nRegulation 5 adjusts the introductory provision about the rules in the 1995 Act for authentication of electronic documents in special cases, e.g. partnerships, companies and office-holders, to follow more closely schedule 2 of the 1995 Act which applies to traditional documents.\nRegulation 6 updates the minimum standard required by reference to in the Cabinet Office Good Practice Guide No. 45 from the requirements for registration of fully electronic documents in the Land Register or the Register of Sasines, and makes a minor correction.\nRegulation 7 provides for the registration of fully electronic documents (within the meaning of the 1995 Act) in the register of deeds and probative writs in the Books of Council and Session, and makes a minor correction. This provision will come into force on 1 October 2022.\nSave as indicated above, the Regulations otherwise come into force on 1 April 2022. Regulations 2 and 3 come into force on the day on which paragraph 12 of schedule 7 of the Coronavirus (Scotland) Act 2020 is re-enacted by Act of the Scottish Parliament.\nA business and regulatory impact assessment has not been provided for this instrument as no significant impact on the private or voluntary sectors is foreseen.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "unitedkingdom:2022:95f5b1e28f", "chunk_id": "unitedkingdom:2022:95f5b1e28f#317d71de93b6646", "source_url": "https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ssi/2022/65/signature/made", "n_chunks_in_doc": 9, "year": 2022, "LegislationType": "Scottish Statutory Instruments", "file_name": "The Registers of Scotland (Digital Registration, etc.) Regulations 2022.txt", "chunk_position": 9, "token_count": 715}}}]}

"Artificial avoidance arrangements in relation to non-domestic rates are defined.", "chunk": {"content": "TOM ARTHUR\nAuthorised to sign by the Scottish Ministers\nSt Andrew’s House,\nEdinburgh\n21st March 2023\nEXPLANATORY NOTE\n(This note is not part of the Regulations)\nThese Regulations make provision to prevent or minimise advantages arising from artificial avoidance arrangements in relation to non-domestic rates. Artificial avoidance arrangements in relation to non-domestic rates are defined in sections 38, 39 and 40 of the Non-Domestic Rates (Scotland) Act 2020.\nThese Regulations prescribe the circumstances in which the owners of lands and heritages, rather than the occupiers, are to be treated as liable to pay non-domestic rates and the circumstances in which any relief (reduction or remittal) in relation to non-domestic rates for those lands and heritages is to cease to be available (Part 2). They also prescribe the circumstances in which changes to lands and heritages causing a reduction in rateable value are to be disregarded (Part 3).\nPart 2 provides that, where a tenancy or other arrangement is in place in respect of lands and heritages, such that the occupier would ordinarily be liable to pay non-domestic rates in respect of them, a local authority must treat the owner as liable where it is satisfied, in all the circumstances, that the tenancy or other arrangement has as one of its main purposes the gaining of an advantage and is an artificial non-domestic rates avoidance arrangement. The provisions only apply in respect of a tenancy or other arrangement entered into on or after 1 April 2023.\nThe circumstances in which a local authority may be satisfied that a tenancy or other arrangement is an artificial non-domestic rates avoidance arrangement include that the lands and heritages are not occupied on a commercial basis, that the body liable to pay non-domestic rates has been, or is being, wound up voluntarily yet the property is still occupied, and that the occupier of the lands and heritages names as the person liable for payment of the rates someone falling within certain prescribed categories. Regulation 5 sets out the process for notification of the owner where a local authority intends to treat them as liable to pay non-domestic rates, which includes an opportunity for the owner to make representations to the local authority.\nRegulation 6 makes provision regarding the date from which any treatment of an owner as liable for payment of non-domestic rates is to have effect, which can be an earlier date than it would otherwise be if the owner has received a similar notice in the past. Regulation 7 makes provision for the removal of non-domestic rates relief (reduction or remittal) where the owner of lands and heritages is treated as liable to pay non-domestic rates under regulation 4. Regulation 7 also requires the owner or tenant to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the local authority, that the making of any subsequent application for relief is not part of an artificial non-domestic rates avoidance arrangement.\nPart 3 requires certain changes to lands and heritages, made on or after 1 April 2023, and which have been assessed as reducing their rateable value, to be disregarded where the local authority is satisfied that the making of the change has as its sole or main purpose the gaining of an advantage and is an artificial non-domestic rates avoidance arrangement. In order to disregard such a change, it must appear to the local authority that the change has been made for no reason other than to reduce the rateable value of the lands and heritages, or that there is no clear link between the change that caused the reduction in rateable value and an intention to make the lands and heritages the subject of economic activity. Regulation 9 sets out the process for notification of the person or body liable to pay the non-domestic rates that the local authority intends to disregard such a change, which includes an opportunity for the person or body to make representations to the local authority. If representations are received, the local authority must issue a final notice advising of its decision.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "unitedkingdom:2023:10990d15aa", "chunk_id": "unitedkingdom:2023:10990d15aa#387ea2ab4da828a", "source_url": "https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ssi/2023/92/signature/made", "n_chunks_in_doc": 10, "year": 2023, "LegislationType": "Scottish Statutory Instruments", "file_name": "The Non-Domestic Rates (Miscellaneous Anti-Avoidance Measures) (Scotland) Regulations 2023.txt", "chunk_position": 10, "token_count": 826}}}]}

The type of dog known as the XL Bully is designated for the purposes of Article 25A of The Dogs (Northern Ireland) Order 1983 (“the 1983 Order”) by Article 2 of the Dangerous Dogs (Designated Types) Order (Northern Ireland) 2024.\nArticle 3 of that Order further provides that the day appointed under Article 25A(1)(c) in respect of dogs of the XL Bully type is 31st December 2024. This means that the possession or custody of a dog of the XL Bully type will be prohibited after this date.\nPart 2 of this Order establishes a compensation scheme in respect of dogs of the XL Bully type where arrangements are made before 31st December 2024 for such dogs to be euthanised. Article 3(1) provides that a person who owns a dog of the XL Bully type and makes arrangements before that date for the dog to be euthanised may apply to the Department for compensation. Article 3(3) provides that, if the Department is satisfied that such an application has been duly made, the Department must arrange for the payment of the specified amount to the applicant.\nArticle 4(1) provides that if a rehoming organisation arranges for an XL Bully type dog to be euthanised before 31st December 2024, it may apply to the Department for compensation towards veterinary costs. Article 4(2) specifies what evidence must be included in an application and that applications must be made on or before 28th February 2025.\nPart 3 establishes an exemption scheme under which owners of dogs of the XL Bully type may apply for an exemption from the prohibition under Article 25A that will apply in respect of the possession of dogs of the XL Bully type on or after 1st January 2025 (“the Article 25A prohibition”).\nArticle 5 makes provision for an exemption from Article 25A(3) of the 1983 Order where the relevant district council has issued a certificate of exemption in respect of the dog and the certificate remains valid. It also makes provision for an exemption to apply where an application for a certificate has been made timeously and is still pending, and for a “grace period” of 14 days following notification of refusal of an application, to allow time for the owner to have the dog euthanised. This will apply only where notification is received on or after 17th December 2024, as it may then be impossible to arrange for the dog to be euthanised before 1st January 2025. Where the holder of a certificate of exemption dies, the certificate of exemption remains valid for a limited period as provided for by Article 5(5)(b), so long as the conditions of exemption are adhered to. A keeper who inherits the dog may make a new application for a certificate of exemption in their own name in accordance with Article 6(7).\nArticle 6 makes provision in relation to applications for a certificate of exemption and specifies who may apply for a certificate and the fee for an application (£92.40). An application for exemption must be made by no later than 31st December 2024, other than for postal applications (where the deadline is 15th December 2024) and for applications under Article 6(7), where the application must be made within three months of the death.\nArticle 7 specifies what must be included in a certificate of exemption and the conditions that the holder must comply with for the certificate to remain valid. Certain requirements will apply throughout the lifetime of the dog.\nArticle 8 specifies the requirement for third-party insurance. The requirements relating to neutering and microchipping (where applicable) in Articles 9 and 10 must be met by the dates specified in those Articles.\nArticle 11 makes provision for the situation where the holder of a certificate of exemption is a rehoming organisation which wishes to relocate the dog from the premises at which it was previously kept to other premises occupied by the organisation. District councils are empowered to vary the certificate of exemption in these circumstances.\nArticle 12 makes provision for replacement certificates to be issued in certain circumstances.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "unitedkingdom:2024:228ac300de", "chunk_id": "unitedkingdom:2024:228ac300de#22439c93982fb05", "source_url": "https://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisr/2024/155/signature", "n_chunks_in_doc": 14, "year": 2024, "LegislationType": "Northern Ireland Statutory Rules", "file_name": "The Dangerous Dogs (Compensation and Exemption Schemes) Order (Northern Ireland) 2024.txt", "chunk_position": 14, "token_count": 939}}}]}

provision of primary medical services by a provider of primary medical services (other than one employed by the Local Health Board), pharmaceutical services by a NHS pharmacist or NHS appliance contractor, local pharmaceutical services provided under a pilot scheme or pharmaceutical services provided by a doctor is likely to be adversely affected by a determination that the premises are not

A person is a “reckonable visitor” at an address if they stay overnight at that address on census night but do not qualify as a “usual resident” at that address, or if they are a visitor from outside the United Kingdom and intend to stay for less than 3 months.\nArticle 4 provides that a return must be made in respect of all usual residents who are alive at midnight at the end of census day, plus any other persons who are present in England and Wales on census night. Usual residents of a home address need not make a return if they are away from home for 6 months continuously from census day, or away from home for 12 months continuously if they are abroad.\nArticle 5 sets out who must make a return. These are persons who live by themselves, householders (as defined), any member of a household who has requested an individual return, every usual resident of addresses in Groups B to F in Schedule 1, every person specified in relation to Group G of Schedule 1 to the Order, and, where a home is occupied exclusively by visitors, the persons who would normally be the usual residents of the home. Article 5 also makes provision for others to be authorised to make returns on behalf of someone else, including in cases of incapacity. Article 5 also provides that the person in charge of a premises or vessel specified in Groups B to F in Schedule 1 must make a return giving the particulars set out in Schedule 3.\nArticle 6 sets out the specific particulars that must be provided by each person making a return. It also specifies the particulars that are not required to be stated in relation to persons below certain years of age on census day.\nThe particulars to be stated in returns are listed in Schedule 2. The particulars in italics in that schedule are particulars that relate to the matters specified in paragraph 6 of the Schedule to the Census Act 1920 (c.41).\nAn impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "wales:2020:26cacdf747", "chunk_id": "wales:2020:26cacdf747#e5b84b7f092f8ae", "source_url": "https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2020/9780111193617/note", "n_chunks_in_doc": 9, "year": 2020, "LegislationType": "UK Draft Statutory Instruments", "file_name": "The Census (England and Wales) Order 2020\nSuperseded by 2020 No. 532.txt", "chunk_position": 9, "token_count": 554}}}]}
